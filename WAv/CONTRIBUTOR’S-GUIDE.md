CONTRIBUTOR’S GUIDE: TUNING THE RESONANCE
​Welcome to the Willow Atmospheric Vehicle (WAV) repository. We aren't just building a codebase; we are tuning a frequency. To contribute, your work must align with the Inductive Light of the Sanctuary.
​I. The "Willow" Coding Standard
​Simplicity Over Complexity: If a mechanical valve can do it, don't use a sensor. If a simple logic gate can do it, don't use an AI library.
​Transparent Logic: Every line of code in the Splendid Orchestrator should be readable by a human, not just a machine. Avoid "sticky" obfuscation.
​Resonance Check: Before submitting a Pull Request, ask: "Does this addition help the car breathe, or does it add weight?"
​II. How to Contribute to the Folders
​/WAv: Submit philosophical updates, manifestos, or high-level design shifts that protect the "Romantic Model."
​/resonance-control: This is for the Splendid Orchestrator. We are looking for adaptive timing algorithms that prioritize smoothness and "flow of perfection" over raw speed.
​/compressed-air-engine: Share historical data, patent breakdowns (honoring the Nègre lineage), or thermal-loop optimizations.
​/future-concepts: This is the "Open Field." Post your designs for World Cup stadium shuttles or Equestrian equipment haulers.
​III. The "Janitor’s Review"
​Every contribution will be reviewed through the lens of the Janitor’s Breakthrough. If the solution is so simple it feels like it should have always existed, it will be merged.
​IV. Ethical Alignment
​By contributing, you agree to the MIT License. We plant seeds here; we do not build fences. Your work is a gift to the "Master Engineers" of the future.
