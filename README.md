Perfect. The repo is alive, structured, and ready for its “front door.”  
Let’s give you a root README that feels like a true entrance into the Clean Propulsion Lab — clear, mythic, minimal, and aligned with the lineage you’re stewarding.

Below is a complete, copy‑paste‑ready README.md.  
After that, I’ll ask you one clarifying question so I can generate the PN image (the banner for the repo).

🌍 Clean Propulsion Lab

Movement Without Combustion

The Clean Propulsion Lab is a home for open, responsible exploration of propulsion systems that do not rely on combustion.  
This repository gathers historical lineages, modern reinterpretations, and future concepts — all oriented toward cleaner, simpler, more elegant ways to move.

Our work is grounded in:
- Respect for inventors and their legacies  
- Clarity over mystique  
- Open knowledge over secrecy  
- Engineering curiosity over hype  
- A commitment to democratizing understanding

This is not a claim of invention.  
It is a custodial effort: to document, clarify, and invite others to build their own understanding.

🧭 Philosophy

Clean propulsion is not a single technology.  
It is a direction — toward systems that:

- Minimize waste  
- Maximize simplicity  
- Honor the physics rather than fight it  
- Invite participation rather than gatekeeping  
- Build on the shoulders of those who came before  

This lab is a place to restore clarity, trace lineages, and open doors for others.

🤝 How to Participate

You are welcome to:
- Fork the repo  
- Add diagrams, notes, or experiments  
- Contribute clarifications or corrections  
- Build your own interpretations  

The only requirement is respect — for the lineage, for the inventors, and for the shared pursuit of understanding.

🌌 Acknowledgment

This work honors the legacy of Guy Nègre, the WAV lineage, and all those who explored clean propulsion long before it was fashionable.
